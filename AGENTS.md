# MAIN HIGH LEVEL PRIORITY: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

Note: The Primary LOOP is I send you either Feedback or console errors or output. At this point you trouble shoot or dev then when you are finished the loop starts over. If feedback is given that the code is building with no errors and minimal warnings and a milestone is reached an update will be recommended where documentation is updated and a GIT is recommended. Do not commit without final approval. Then the loop continues after you recommend 3 options to proceed next.
